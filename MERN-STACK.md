# MERN Stack

## Introduction

**MERN stack** is the name given to a set of _JavaScript_ based technologies used in developing _web applications_. **MERN** is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including:

* **Mongo DB**
* **Express JS**
* **React JS/ Redux**
* **Node JS**

Among these technologies Mongo DB is a _database system_, Node JS is a _back-end runtime environment_, Express JS is a _back-end web framework_ and React is a _front-end framework_.

Given the popularity of React on the frontend and of Node.js on the back-end, the MERN stack is one of the most popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page app.

### Mongo DB

* Mongo DB is a _free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented_ database program that provides persistence for application data.
* Mongo DB is developed by _Mongo DB Inc._, and is published under a combination of the _GNU Affero General Public License_ and _the Apache License_.
* Classified as a **No SQL database program**.
* Bridges the gap between _key-value stores_ (fast and scalable) and _relational databases_ (rich functionality).
* Stores data as **JSON** documents in collections with dynamic schemas.
* Designed with _scalability_ and _developer agility_ in mind.
* Designed to be used asynchronously thus it pairs well with Node.js applications.

### Express

* Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as _free and open-source software_ under _the MIT License_.
* It is designed for building _web applications_ and APIs.
* It has been called the _de facto standard server framework_ for Node.js.
* The original author, _TJ Holowaychuk_, described it as a _Sinatra-inspired_ server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins.
* Basically runs the back-end code as a module within the Node.js environment.
* It **Handles the routing of requests** to the right parts of your app.

### React

* React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
* React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
* Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

### Node JS

* Node.js is an _open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment_ that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
* Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.
* Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
* It is an asynchronous event-driven engine, which means the app makes a request for some data and then performs other tasks while waiting for a response.
* Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

#### Note

The MERN stack wasn’t always the front-runner in the JavaScript web app game. Many companies and developers still use the MEAN stack, which is identical to the MERN stack except it uses AngularJS or Angular instead of React for the frontend. One of the distinguishing features from React is the virtual DOM manipulation, which helps keep apps dynamic and fast.

## The Benefits of the MERN Stack

The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.

For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.

Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.
