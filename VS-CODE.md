# VISUAL STUDIO CODE

## INTRODUCTRION

Visual Studio code is **lightweight** and **powerfull** source code editor developed by **Microsoft** for

* **Windows**
* **Linux**
* **MacOS**

It comes with built-in support for **_JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js_** and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages **(_such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go_)** and runtimes **(_such as .NET and Unity_)**.

It includes support for _debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets,_ and _code refactoring._

## FEATURES

### 1. Huge language Support

* Not only is VS Code available cross-platform, it aims to be your one-stop code editor with support for **30+ programming languages** out-of-the-box.
* You get built-in syntax highlighting and bracket matching in your code, as well as easy code navigation.

### 2. Side-by-Side Editing

* Control click on a file from your project explorer and, voila, multiple files open up side by side, pre-docked and ready for edits.
* VS Code can support up to three simultaneous file edits, each of which can be launched from the command prompt as well.

### 3. Command Palette

* One of the powerful utilities of VS Code that you may want to keep handy is the Command Palette – simply hit Command/Control+Shift+P to bring it up.
* Furthermore, if your development project supports special command line tooling, VS Code Command Palette is smart enough to understand and offer help

### 4. Function  Parameter

* One of the nifty IntelliSense features of VS Code is helping out with typed function parameters during corresponding invocation, thus allowing easy code completion. This obviously works with programming language/system functions, but is also smart enough to offer help on custom functions that you have in your code.

### 5. Integrated Version Control

* It would painful is developers had to step outside their code editor to accomplish version control tasks – so VS Code has Git integration built-in. VS Code works with any Git repo – local or remote, and offers visual cues to resolve conflicts before code commits.
* Simply start up the version control from the Viewbar on left, point to your Git repo and off you go. VS Code will start tracking files for changes and offer stage/unstage/commit actions for your code. You get a complete version control experience without having to ever leave VS Code.

## Plugins

### 1. ESLint

Here is for all the linting for your Javascript and jsx. Plug-able and makes sure you stick to standard practices like indentation and positioning and many more. It is one of the most downloaded extensions in VS Code with almost _12 million downloads_.

### 2. Prettier - Code formatter

This very popular extension by Esben Petersen. It currently boasts of having almost 4 million downloads. It helps format Javascript code, colors keywords to make your code easily readable. There are similar extensions and one of the popular ones is beautify (which is also available on the marketplace).

### 3. SVG Viewer

This extension adds a number of utilities for working with SVGs in Visual Studio Code. It makes it possible to render SVG files and see how they look like without having to leave the editor. There are also options for converting to PNG and generating data URI schemes.

### 4. Git History

* View and search git log along with the graph and details.
* View a previous copy of the file.
* View and search the history
  * View the history of one or all branches (git log)
  * View the history of a file
  * View the history of a line in a file (Git Blame).
  * View the history of an author
* Compare:
  * Compare branches
  * Compare commits
  * Compare files across commits
* Miscellaneous features:
  * Github avatars
  * Cherry-picking commits
  * Reverting commits
  * Create branches from a commits
  * View commit information in a treeview (snapshot of all changes)
  * Merge and rebase

### 5. Indent-Rainbow

This extension colorizes the indentation in front of your text alternating four different colors on each step. Some may find it helpful in writing code for Nim or Python.
It uses the current editor window tab size and can handle mixed tab + spaces but that is not recommended. In addition it visibly marks lines where the indentation is not a multiple of the tab size. This should help to find problems with indentation in some situations.

### 6. Markdown Preview Enhanced

Markdown Preview Enhanced is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities such as automatic scroll sync, math typesetting, mermaid, PlantUML, pandoc, PDF export, code chunk, presentation writer, etc. A lot of its ideas are inspired by Markdown Preview Plus and RStudio Markdown.

### 7. EditorConfig for VS Code

This plugin attempts to override user/workspace settings with settings found in _.editorconfig_ files. No additional or _vscode-specific_ files are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if _root=true_ is not specified, EditorConfig will continue to look for an _.editorconfig_ file outside of the project.

### 8. JS Refactor

JS Refactor is the Javascript automated refactoring tool for Visual Studio Code, built to smooth and streamline your development experience.
It provides an extensive list of automated actions including the commonly needed: Extract Method, Extract Variable, Inline Variable, and an alias for the built-in VS Code rename. JS Refactor also supports many common snippets and associated actions for wrapping existing code in common block expressions.

Supported Language Files

* Javascript/ECMAScript (.js)
* HTML (.htm, .html)
